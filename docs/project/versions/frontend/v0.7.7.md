# frontend v0.7.7

**Release Date**: 2025-10-08
**Docker Image**: `financial-agent/frontend:0.7.7`

## Overview

Enhanced chat layout to make assistant responses occupy full width for better readability and visual consistency.

## Features Added

### 1. Full-Width Assistant Responses

**Before:**
```
Assistant messages: max-w-3xl with mr-8 right margin
→ Narrow responses with extra whitespace on right
→ Inconsistent width based on content
```

**After:**
```
Assistant messages: w-full (100% width)
→ Responses fill entire chat area
→ Consistent, prominent display
→ Better utilization of screen space
```

**Benefits:**
- **Improved Readability**: Tables, charts, and analysis content use full width
- **Visual Consistency**: Responses have uniform width like Gemini chat
- **Content Prominence**: Assistant responses are the key content, now displayed prominently
- **Better UX**: No wasted whitespace on the right side

**Technical Changes:**
- Removed `lg:max-w-3xl` constraint from assistant messages
- Removed `mr-8` right margin
- Changed to `w-full` for consistent full-width layout

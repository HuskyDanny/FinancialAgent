**Release Date**: 2025-10-08
**Docker Image**: `klinematrix/frontend:test-v0.4.5`

## Overview

Chat deletion UI with optimistic updates, confirmation dialog, and comprehensive ESLint configuration.

## Features Added

### Chat Delete Functionality
- **Trash icon button** in ChatListItem (visible on hover)
- **Confirmation dialog** before deletion

### ESLint Configuration Improvements
- Added `eslint-plugin-react` for React best practices
- Added `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for accessibility checks
- Configured comprehensive React rules:
  - `react/jsx-key: error` - Enforce keys in lists
  - `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks: error` - Enforce Rules of Hooks
  - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: warn` - Check hook dependencies
- Auto-detect React version
- Downgraded TypeScript `unsafe any` errors to warnings

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed ESLint configuration to use `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` syntax

## Breaking Changes

None

## Compatibility

| Component | Required Version |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Backend | 0.4.3+ (for delete endpoint) |
| Node.js | 18+ |
| React | 18.2+ |

## UI/UX Changes

### Chat Sidebar
- Hover over chat → trash icon appears on the right
- Click trash → confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete this chat? This action cannot be undone."
- On confirm → chat instantly removed from list
- On error → chat reappears + error alert
- If deleted chat was active → creates new empty chat

## Known Issues

- 680 linting warnings/errors in pre-existing code (not from this release)
  - 143 errors (case declarations, unused vars, etc.)
  - 537 warnings (TypeScript `any` types)
  - All errors are in legacy code (ChatInterface.tsx, etc.)
  - New code is lint-clean

## Migration Guide

No migration needed. This is a backward-compatible addition.

Delete functionality only appears if backend v0.4.3+ is deployed.

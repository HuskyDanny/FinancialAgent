# frontend v0.7.2

**Release Date**: 2025-10-08
**Docker Image**: `financial-agent/frontend:0.7.2`

## Overview

Enhanced UX improvements: user messages for button clicks, table-based analysis formatting, and cleaner output.

## Features Added

- **User Messages for Quick Analysis**: When clicking quick analysis buttons (Fibonacci, Fundamentals, Macro, Stochastic), a user message is automatically inserted showing what analysis was triggered (e.g., "Start Fibonacci analysis for AAPL on 1d period from 2024-01-01 to 2024-06-30")
  - Auto-scroll works like Gemini chat - scrolls to user message position first
  - Assistant response appears below user message
  - Clear conversation thread showing what triggered each analysis

- **Table-Based Analysis Formatting**: Replaced nested bullet points with clean markdown tables
  - Fibonacci: Bottom line metrics table + Fibonacci levels table
  - Macro: Bottom line table + sector performance table
  - Fundamentals: Bottom line table + valuation/trading table
  - Stochastic: Readings table with %K, %D, Signal
  - Easier to scan and compare values
  - More professional financial analysis look

- **Cleaner Output**: Removed redundant explanatory text
  - Removed verbose text like "Stochastic oscillator shows %K at 73.4% and %D at 78.9%, indicating..."
  - Data presented in tables speaks for itself
  - Reduced visual noise and improved readability

# frontend v0.7.3

**Release Date**: 2025-10-08
**Docker Image**: `financial-agent/frontend:0.7.3`

## Overview

Fixed auto-scroll behavior to match Gemini chat - now scrolls to the latest user message instead of the bottom of all messages.

## Bug Fixes

- **Auto-scroll to Latest User Message**: Changed scroll behavior to position the user's question in view, with the assistant response appearing below
  - Previously scrolled to the absolute bottom of the message list
  - Now finds the last user message and scrolls to that position
  - For restored chats (no recent user message), falls back to scrolling to bottom
  - Matches Gemini chat UX: see your question, response streams below

**Implementation:**
- Added `lastUserMessageRef` to track the most recent user message
- Logic: If last user message is within the last 2 messages, scroll to it; otherwise scroll to bottom
- Uses reverse search to find last user message efficiently

# frontend v0.7.4

**Release Date**: 2025-10-08
**Docker Image**: `financial-agent/frontend:0.7.4`

## Overview

Fixed table rendering and removed redundant text from Stochastic analysis output.

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Tables Now Render Properly

**Problem**: Markdown tables were showing as plain text with pipes and dashes instead of rendering as actual HTML tables with borders and cells.

**Root Cause**: ReactMarkdown components object was missing table-related components (table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td). The remarkGfm plugin parses table syntax, but without custom components, they weren't styled.

**Fix**: Added table component styling to ChatMessages.tsx
- `table`: Bordered table with overflow wrapper
- `thead`: Gray background header
- `tbody`: Standard body
- `tr`: Bottom borders between rows
- `th`: Left-aligned bold headers with right borders
- `td`: Data cells with right borders

**Result**: Tables now render with:
- Clear borders around cells and table
- Gray header background
- Proper cell padding (px-4 py-2)
- Horizontal scroll for wide tables

### 2. Removed Redundant Stochastic Summary

**Problem**: Stochastic analysis had a "üìù Summary" section that just repeated data already shown in the table:
- "Stochastic oscillator shows %K at 73.4% and %D at 78.9%, indicating..."
- This verbose text duplicated the Bottom Line table

**Fix**: Removed the Summary section entirely from Stochastic formatter
- Kept Bottom Line table (clean data presentation)
- Kept Key Insights (actionable bullets)
- Kept Recent Signals (historical events)

**Result**: Cleaner output without redundant explanatory text

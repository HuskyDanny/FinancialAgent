# backend v0.4.8

**Release Date**: 2025-10-08
**Docker Image**: `financial-agent/backend:0.4.8`

## Overview

Enhanced LLM system prompt to provide more natural, conversational responses for follow-up questions while maintaining structured clarity for initial analysis.

## Features Added

### 1. Context-Adaptive Response Style

**Before:**
- Rigid structure forced for ALL responses
- Every message started with "**The Verdict**", "**The Evidence**", etc.
- Follow-up questions felt robotic and over-structured

**After:**
- Adaptive response style based on conversation context
- Initial analysis: Clear structured sections (conclusion, evidence, insights, risks)
- Follow-up questions: Natural, conversational responses
- LLM matches formatting style from conversation history

**Benefits:**
- More human-like conversation flow
- Better multi-turn chat experience
- Maintains analysis quality while improving UX
- LLM respects established formatting patterns

### 2. Simplified Instructions

**Removed:**
- Mandatory "The Verdict", "The Evidence" section labels
- Over-prescriptive "You MUST start EVERY response with..." rules
- Excessive structural requirements

**Added:**
- Clear distinction: "For Initial Analysis" vs "For Follow-Up Questions"
- Instruction to match tone and style from conversation history
- Flexibility while maintaining core principles

### 3. Example Patterns

**Initial Analysis Example:**
```
AAPL presents a high-probability long setup with momentum turning bullish.
The stochastic oscillator (%K at 75.2) crossed above its signal line...

For long-term investors, this confirms upward trajectory...
For traders, momentum favors swing positions...

Risk: Based on 6-month data. Market weakness could invalidate this setup.
```

**Follow-Up Example:**
```
User: "What about the P/E ratio?"
Assistant: "The P/E is elevated at 28x, above the S&P 500's 20x average. This reflects premium valuation for AAPL's strong fundamentals and brand moat. Not a concern for quality growth, but means less margin for error if earnings disappoint."
```

## Technical Changes

**File Modified:** `backend/src/agent/llm_client.py`

**System Prompt Updates:**
1. Split response style into "Initial Analysis" and "Follow-Up Questions"
2. For follow-ups:
   - "Be conversational and natural - no rigid formatting"
   - "Match the tone and style established in the conversation history"
   - "Keep the same formatting approach (tables, bullets, emphasis) as prior messages"
   - "Answer directly without unnecessary structure"

3. Updated MUST NOT rules:
   - "Force rigid structure ('The Verdict', 'The Evidence') on follow-up questions"

4. Simplified examples to show both structured and conversational patterns

# Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for all new features before implementation.

## Purpose

Feature specs ensure:
- Clear understanding of requirements before coding
- Alignment between stakeholders and developers
- Design decisions are documented
- Implementation scope is well-defined
- Acceptance criteria are established upfront

## When to Create a Feature Spec

Create a feature spec for:
- ✅ New user-facing features
- ✅ Significant architectural changes
- ✅ New API endpoints or data models
- ✅ Complex business logic
- ✅ Third-party integrations

Skip feature specs for:
- ❌ Bug fixes (use troubleshooting docs instead)
- ❌ Minor refactoring
- ❌ Documentation updates
- ❌ Dependency upgrades

## Feature Spec Template

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

> **Status**: [Draft | Under Review | Approved | Implemented]
> **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
> **Owner**: [Your Name]

## Context

Why is this feature needed? What user problem does it solve?

**User Story**:
As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit].

**Background**:
- Current situation and limitations
- Business/user impact
- Related features or dependencies

## Problem Statement

Clear, concise description of the problem to solve.

**Current Pain Points**:
1. [Pain point 1]
2. [Pain point 2]

**Success Metrics**:
- How will we measure success?
- What KPIs or user metrics should improve?

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach

Describe the technical approach at a conceptual level.

### Architecture Changes

**New Components**:
- Component 1: Purpose and responsibilities
- Component 2: Purpose and responsibilities

**Modified Components**:
- Existing component: What changes and why

**Data Models**:
```python
# Example Pydantic model
class NewFeature(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    created_at: datetime
```

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/feature          Create new feature
GET    /api/feature/{id}     Get feature by ID
PUT    /api/feature/{id}     Update feature
DELETE /api/feature/{id}     Delete feature
```

### UI/UX Changes

**New Screens/Components**:
- Screen 1: Description, mockup or wireframe
- Component 1: Purpose and behavior

**User Flow**:
1. User navigates to...
2. User clicks...
3. System responds with...

### Technical Implementation Details

**Frontend**:
- React components to create/modify
- State management approach
- API integration points

**Backend**:
- New routes/endpoints
- Database schema changes
- External API integrations

**Database**:
- New collections/tables
- Indexes required
- Migration strategy

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Task 1: Description
- [ ] Task 2: Description

### Phase 2: Core Feature
- [ ] Task 3: Description
- [ ] Task 4: Description

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Task 5: Description
- [ ] Task 6: Description

**Estimated Effort**: [X days/weeks]

## Acceptance Criteria

Feature is complete when:

- [ ] **Functional Requirements**:
  - [ ] Criterion 1
  - [ ] Criterion 2

- [ ] **Technical Requirements**:
  - [ ] All tests passing
  - [ ] Code reviewed and approved
  - [ ] Documentation updated

- [ ] **User Experience**:
  - [ ] UI matches design specs
  - [ ] Error handling is user-friendly
  - [ ] Performance meets targets (e.g., <200ms response time)

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- Test A: What it validates
- Test B: What it validates

**Integration Tests**:
- Test C: End-to-end flow
- Test D: External API integration

**Manual Testing**:
1. Test scenario 1
2. Test scenario 2

## Security Considerations

- Authentication/authorization requirements
- Data validation rules
- Sensitive data handling
- Rate limiting needs

## Performance Considerations

- Expected load (requests/second, concurrent users)
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy
- Resource limits

## Rollout Strategy

**Development**:
- Feature flag: `enable_feature_x`
- Test with internal users first

**Production**:
- Phased rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Monitoring metrics during rollout
- Rollback plan if issues detected

## Open Questions

1. Question 1?
   - Options: A, B, C
   - Decision: TBD

2. Question 2?
   - Options: X, Y
   - Decision: TBD

## Dependencies

- Dependency 1: Why needed, current status
- Dependency 2: Why needed, current status

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High | Medium | Mitigation strategy |
| Risk 2 | Low | High | Mitigation strategy |

## Change Log

- **YYYY-MM-DD**: Initial draft
- **YYYY-MM-DD**: Updated based on review feedback
- **YYYY-MM-DD**: Approved and implementation started
```

## Example Feature Specs

Browse existing feature specs in this directory for examples:
- [Example coming soon]

## Workflow

1. **Create Draft**: Copy template above, fill in details
2. **Discussion**: Review with team, gather feedback
3. **Approval**: Get sign-off before implementation
4. **Implementation**: Reference spec during development
5. **Update**: Keep spec updated if design changes
6. **Archive**: Mark as "Implemented" when complete

## Tips

- **Be specific**: Vague specs lead to rework
- **Include examples**: Code snippets, mockups, user flows
- **Think through edge cases**: What happens when...?
- **Consider non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
- **Link to related docs**: Don't duplicate, reference existing documentation

# Frontend v0.8.16

**Release Date**: 2025-11-11

## Overview

Rebuild of v0.8.14 with latest code including Portfolio Dashboard features that were missing from the previously deployed image.

## What Changed

**This is a REBUILD, not new features** - ensuring deployed image matches current codebase:

- Order execution records table showing Alpaca trades
- Portfolio agent analysis sidebar with chat history
- Integration with Alpaca Trading API

### Other Features
- All existing v0.8.14 features
- Latest styling and UX improvements

## Technical Details

- No code changes from v0.8.14
- Same dependencies and build configuration
- Simply rebuilding with current codebase

## Deployment

Backend v0.5.14 already has all required portfolio endpoints. Only frontend rebuild needed.

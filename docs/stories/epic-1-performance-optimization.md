# Epic 1: Performance Optimization

**Status**: Active
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Target Completion**: TBD

---

## Epic Overview

**As a** platform operator and user,
**I want** the Financial Agent platform to respond quickly and efficiently,
**so that** users have a smooth experience during market analysis and the system can scale to support more concurrent users.

## Business Context

The Financial Agent is in production at https://klinecubic.cn. As the platform scales, performance optimization becomes critical for:
- User experience (response times)
- Operational costs (efficient resource utilization)
- Scalability (supporting concurrent users)
- Reliability (system stability under load)

## Epic Scope

This epic covers comprehensive performance optimization across all layers:

| Area | Description | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| API Response Time | Endpoint optimization, N+1 queries, database tuning | High |
| Caching Strategy | Redis hit rates, TTL tuning, cache invalidation | High |
| LLM/Agent Performance | Tool execution, streaming latency, token optimization | High |
| Frontend Performance | Bundle size, lazy loading, render optimization | Medium |
| Infrastructure | Pod resources, connection pooling, scaling | Medium |

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Performance Audit & Baseline Metrics
**Status**: Draft
**Estimate**: Medium

Establish current performance metrics and identify bottlenecks across all layers.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Document baseline metrics for all API endpoints (P50, P95, P99 response times)
2. Measure and document Redis cache hit/miss ratios
3. Profile LLM/Agent tool execution times and token usage
4. Analyze frontend bundle size and Core Web Vitals
5. Document current infrastructure resource utilization (CPU, Memory)
6. Identify and prioritize top 5 performance bottlenecks
7. Create performance monitoring dashboard or document

**Status**: Pending
**Estimate**: Large
**Depends On**: 1.1

Optimize slow endpoints identified in the audit.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Fix any N+1 query patterns identified
2. Add database indexes for slow queries
3. Implement query pagination where missing
4. Reduce P95 response time by 30% for identified slow endpoints
5. All optimizations have unit tests

### Story 1.6: Infrastructure Optimization
**Status**: Pending
**Estimate**: Medium
**Depends On**: 1.1

Optimize Kubernetes resource allocation and connections.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

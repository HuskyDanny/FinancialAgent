2025-12-13 10:07:00 [info] Phase 3: No actionable orders after optimization

VERIFICATION: Decision was HOLD for AAPL, so no orders were placed - this is CORRECT behavior.
The system correctly:
1. Analyzed AAPL symbol (Phase 1)
2. Generated HOLD decision with 8/10 confidence (Phase 2)
3. Converted decision to execution plan but found no actionable orders since HOLD means no trade (Phase 3)

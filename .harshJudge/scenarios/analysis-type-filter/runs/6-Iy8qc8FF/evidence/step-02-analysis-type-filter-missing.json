FAILURE: Analysis Type Filter dropdown is NOT present in the UI.

Investigation findings:
1. The PortfolioDashboard.tsx uses ChatSidebar component (line 247-259)
2. ChatSidebar supports filterUserId for portfolio mode but does NOT have analysisType filter prop
3. The AnalysisTypeFilter.tsx component does NOT exist
4. The PortfolioChatSidebar.tsx that was supposed to contain the filter does NOT exist

Root cause: The frontend Analysis Type Filter was never fully integrated into the UI.

The backend API supports the filter via ?analysis_type=individual|portfolio parameter,
but the frontend component to select this filter was never added to the ChatSidebar.

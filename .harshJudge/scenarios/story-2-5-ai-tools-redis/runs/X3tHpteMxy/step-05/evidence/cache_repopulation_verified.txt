Cache Repopulation Verification:

1. After MongoDB fallback, cache was empty (design: cache-aside pattern)
2. Triggered snapshot via POST /api/admin/insights/trigger-snapshot
3. Backend logs: "Snapshot cached in Redis cache_key=insights:ai_sector_risk:latest ttl_seconds=86400"
4. Redis verification:
   - EXISTS insights:ai_sector_risk:latest = 1 (key exists)
   - TTL insights:ai_sector_risk:latest = 86385 seconds (~24 hours)

Cache repopulation works correctly via snapshot cron job.
Design: Cache is populated during writes (snapshot), not on reads (cache-aside pattern).

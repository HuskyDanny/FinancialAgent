AI Automation Workflow
Trigger Sources:

Push / PR
Nightly scheduled scan
New issue labeled ai-fix
Failing regression scenario
Detection Layer (ai/detectors/):

Static AST & pattern rules (performance anti-patterns, misuse of libraries)
Test failure parser (map stack trace → probable module)
Regression diff comparator (image hash delta, numeric tolerance exceed)
Dependency vulnerability ingest (e.g., GH Advisory → map to requirements)
Classification & Root Cause:

Scoring heuristic: (confidence, blast_radius, complexity)
If confidence > threshold → proceed to patch generation
Patch Generation (ai/patch_generators/):

Creates branch: ai/fix/<issue-or-hash>
Generates unified diff (enforces small scope)
Inserts/updates tests (unit or regression scenario) when missing
Updates change doc stub in changes/<date>-<tag>.md
Validation Sandbox (ai/sandbox/):

Build container
Run: lint → type check → unit tests → integration tests → focused regression cases
Compute metrics delta (runtime, memory, image size)
PR Creation (ai/pr_agent/):

Title: fix: <short summary> (AI Auto)
Body sections: Problem | Root Cause | Proposed Fix | Tests Added | Risk | Rollback
Attaches artifacts: before/after metrics, failing test reproduction log
Human Review Assist:

Labels: ai-generated, needs-review
Reviewer suggestions from CODEOWNERS mapping
If low risk + high confidence & passes gating policies → optional auto-merge rule
Post-Merge:

changes/ doc file kept
SBOM & dependency diff appended to PR comments (optional)
Regression baselines updated only if fix explicitly marked baselines:update
Change Documentation (changes/*.md Template)
Front matter:
date: 2025-09-20 id: ISSUE-123 type: bugfix area: backend.analysis ai_generated: true confidence: 0.86
Sections:

Question (Observed Problem)
Root Cause Analysis
Resolution Approach
Patch Summary (files touched)
Tests Added / Updated
Metrics Before vs After
Risk & Mitigations
Rollback Plan
Follow-ups
Test Strategy
Unit Tests:

Scope: pure functions (analysis calculations)
Fast, parallel, run every commit
Integration Tests:

API endpoints (mock external I/O)
Storage abstraction
Regression Tests:

Golden JSON (analysis output)
Image structural similarity (SSIM) or hash (permissible delta threshold)
Performance budget assertions (e.g., chart gen < 5s)
Failure Handling:

If regression drift small & intentional → require baseline update tag in PR
Large drift blocks merge
CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
backend-ci.yml:

Checkout
Cache deps
Lint (ruff) + Type check (mypy)
Unit tests
Integration tests
Build image
Trivy scan
Upload coverage + OpenAPI spec
regression-benchmark.yml:

Trigger: nightly, manual, or label
Run regression tests
Compare to baselines
Post summary comment / open issue if drift
nightly-ai-audit.yml:

Run detectors
Attempt auto-fixes (up to N)
Open PRs
deploy-prod.yml (manual approval):

Pull image digest from build
Verify signature (cosign)
Apply k8s manifests (kubectl or helm)
Run smoke tests (probe /health)
Canary route % traffic (progressive) if using service mesh/ALB weighting
auto-fix-pr.yml:

On labeled issue ai-fix → run patch generator pipeline
frontend-ci.yml:

Lint (eslint)
Type check (tsc)
Unit tests (vitest / jest)
Build
Upload static artifacts → OSS
Invalidate CDN (if prod & approved)
Regression Baseline Handling
baselines stored in backend/tests/regression/baselines/
Each scenario: scenario-id/
input.json
expected_analysis.json
expected_chart.hash (or .png for manual diff)
update_baselines.py script compares & writes new baseline with explicit flag
AI agent never overwrites baselines without baseline-update intent
Security & Governance
Policies:

OPA / Conftest on k8s manifests (infrastructure/security)
Dependency allowlist & banned patterns
Secret scanning pre-merge
Signed images + provenance (SLSA level attempt)
AI Guardrails:

Patch size limit (e.g., < 400 lines changed)
No changes to infra/ or security/ directories unless labeled infrastructure-change
Require human approval if touching auth, storage, or financial calculation core modules
Observability as Code
grafana-dashboards/*.json versioned
alert-rules/*.yaml synced to cluster (GitOps)
logging-parsers/ for structured log ingestion
Development Workflow Summary
dev → branch → push → CI (lint+tests) → PR (manual or AI) → review → merge → build & sign → deploy staging → regression → promote prod

Recommended Next Steps
Create new directories (frontend/, ai/, infrastructure/, docs/, changes/)
Introduce FastAPI API layer + storage abstraction (re-add).
Add regression test harness + baseline format.
Add initial GitHub Actions workflows skeleton.
Implement minimal AI detector (e.g., failing test root cause stub).

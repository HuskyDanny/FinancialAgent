Trading Decision Models for Structured LLM Output.

These models enable reliable extraction of trading decisions from LLM responses
using `with_structured_output()` instead of regex parsing.

Architecture:
- TradingDecision: Phase 1 output per symbol (individual analysis)
- OptimizedOrder: Single order in the execution plan
- OrderExecutionPlan: Phase 2 aggregated output (after agent optimization)

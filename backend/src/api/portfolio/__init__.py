"""
Portfolio API module for Alpaca paper trading integration.

Provides REST API access to portfolio functionality including:
- Holdings: Current positions and account summary from Alpaca
- Transactions: Transaction history from MongoDB (includes failures)
- Orders: Order history from Alpaca API
- History: Portfolio value time series and chat history

All portfolio data comes from Alpaca API (single source of truth).
No manual holdings management - Alpaca handles all positions.

This module aggregates all portfolio sub-routers into a single main router.
Backward compatibility is maintained - you can still import `router` directly:
    from src.api.portfolio import router
